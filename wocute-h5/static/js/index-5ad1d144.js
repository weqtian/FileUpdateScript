We hope to build a warm and careful atmosphere through content guidance and mutual assistance between users. The users here are all female, and they are anonymous to each other, which can well protect your personal privacy. </p><p class="p2" data-v-8b572b4d> There are official daily posts about essential topics such as period&amp;cylces, food&amp;fitness, pregnancy&amp;fertility, beauty&amp;fashion, parenting&amp;child rearing, women&#39;s physical health&amp;phychological health, etc. Most of the posts will be timely replied to by WOCUTE official accounts and enthusiastic users. Through these communities, you can post, comment, vote, discuss, learn, debate, support, and connect with people who share your interests, and we encourage you to find your home on WOUCTE. </p><p class="p2" data-v-8b572b4d> While not every content may be for you(and you may find some unrelatable or even offensive), no community should be used as a weapon. Communities should create a sense of belonging for their members, not try to diminish it for others. Likewise, everyone on WOCUTE should have an expectation of privacy and safety, so please respect the privacy and safety of others. </p><p class="p2" data-v-8b572b4d> Warmth community on Reddit is defined by its users. Users can find the [Hide] button in every post’s menu to avoid objectable posts from the feed. Some of these users help manage the community by Report Mechanism for users to report objectable posts and provide additional advice about specific posts or abusive users and our audit team will deal with these objectable contents or abusive uses as soon as possible. Below are the rules that apply to everyone on WOCUTE. These rules are enforced by us, the admins. </p><p class="p2" data-v-8b572b4d> WOCUTE and its communities are only what we make of them together, and can only exist if we operate by a shared set of rules. We ask that you abide by not just the letter of these rules, but the spirit as well. </p></section><section data-v-8b572b4d><h4 data-v-8b572b4d>COMMUNITY RULES</h4><h5 class="p3" data-v-8b572b4d>1.  Be Civil</h5><p class="p2" data-v-8b572b4d> Even though we are an anonymous community, there exists a real human behind every anonymous identity.
